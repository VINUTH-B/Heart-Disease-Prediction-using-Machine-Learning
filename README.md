#Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project uses a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on several medical attributes. It‚Äôs a clean, beginner-friendly end-to-end implementation of data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and classification using logistic regression.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset `heart.csv` contains 13 features and 1 target variable indicating heart disease presence (1) or absence (0).
